Hermann Sch√ºrrer   EUROPA: Die Toten haben nichts zu lachen.
    After this intimate interlude and more of the kind, I
decided to take up my cross, and having otherwise no idea how
to spend my time, to take up some occupation which tied in,
approximately at least, with my interests. I thought it over
for years, tried first this and then that, but the limitations,
the routine, and the compulsion involved in all forms of work
with which I was unable to identify myself, repelled me. All
right: the orchid and tne marigold can exist in a swamp and in
a village both the cretin and the carver of crucifixes, in the
town there's the pub-crawl on Saturday night and the Sunday
outing to the country, it's the fate of humanity to be either
hammer or anvil. Knowing as I did that a board of examiners
gave the future German dramatist Gerhart Hauptmann C minus for
German language, and that another board declared Giuseppi Verdi
to be unmusical, on the whole I felt more inclined to test the
competence of the board of examiners than to follow the dubious
reciprocal procedure. Finally, I was obliged - pecunia olet -
to take the plunge, I was assessed as of average intelligence and
was given excellent marks. I noticed the intolerable arrogance
of these little a sses, the presumption which issued fron their
heads, leaving them hollow. It amused me. I translated the
bill of lading of a British trading vessel from the King's English
into Lutheran German. A truckload of files shipped from Bombay,
heading for Liverpool. I was taken aback. Could this be a portent?
To clarify the situation I added to my translation a comment that
the bill of lading must be fictitious. Like all colonial powers,
England only exploited her colonies (in this case India) by
importing raw materials. So as to keep the colonies trotting
trotting on a lead, weak and well-behaved, they processed the booty
it the mother country. Those were the golden years when the.
illiterate natives had to work for the primary school literate
white colonisers. All this, together with opium plantations and
other tricks, was presumably the cause of starvation and poverty
in the developing countries today, and had led in these parts of
the world to the total loss of prestige of the European countries.
Thus I became a bank clerk, but the manager explained to me that

commentaries were out of place here and that I should confine
myself to handling the financinl operations of the bank. How
did Brecht put it? It is more lucrative and criminal to found
a bank than to rob it. I saw the way that the employees
didn't dare to go home after working hours, the way that they
watched each other and worked on, because they were afraid of
the sack. This servility revolted me to such an extent thet I
chose the lesser of two evils, true to the proverb: non scolae
sed vitae discimus, and continued my studies. I busied myself
with characterology and occupational idiocy, and once I had
confronted the individual occupations - stripped of the nimbus
which they diffused - with reality, I arrived at extraordinarily
depressing conclusions. Primarily, I was interested in those
professions, spiritual, intellectual and secular, which form the
backbone of society. This a dded up to a moral deficit, the
debit and credit of which appeared to have sprung from the mind
of a maniac, a public danger poisoning all other living beings.
Again and again I had to call to mind the remark of the English
historian Lord Acton, so as to understand the state of the world:
power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. This
corruption begins at the root of the incipiently rotten fruit,
with the teacher and the young. The young person is brought up
to be a good citizen, normally speaking a human being with many
duties and no idea of his in any case scanty rights. Take any
state form at random: dictatorship, oligarchy, democracy, and
the teacher is an obedient mercenary who is compelled to cook,
suppress or over-emphasize the facts, so that he is training the
young person rather than teaching him. The results we saw and
we see in the faithful subject, venial and without character,
a vegetative creature erroneously equipped with a brain.
Brains on toast. It is only in the natural sciences, since the
Pope and le bon dieu have withdrawm a little, that it is seldom
possible to act the white sepulchre, at nuclear defence (or
attack) parties. I have often wondered what the definition of
the state is, and who has convincingly defined it. I had the
choice, and on account of my own experiences I chose no submissive
constitutional philosopher but an independent thinker, the Danish

philosopher Kierkegaard with his epigrammatic bullseye: "the
state is the most antisocial being". Shakespeare once trans-
planted a saying ~~by~~ spoken by Hamlet which is now proverbial
(i.e. it is valid for all the world) to Denmark: "There is
something rotten in the state of Denmark." That this applied
in neither case to Denmark alone, or in the second case only to
Shakespeare's time, I don't need to point out, the 20th century
too was never short of dead men. This is the angle from which |
civil servants are to be considered. The politicians in their
dirty trade, who lost face long ago but are able to bluff their
way through because politics are off limits for the people. The
opportunist~~ic~~ way they shift their ground, yes/no compromises,
in case of necessity their change of allegiance and use of force.
The judge who represents the threadbare legal principles of his
state, so that one state demands the death sentence, another,
life, the third an acquittal. The subjective, arbitrary
character of the judgments, months or years according to
discretion, the varying capacity of the judge, from stupidity
to the human average, the latent venality, political when the 
Reichstag burned, financial, not charging Krupp with aiding and
abetting murder, but giving him an order for distinguished public
service, aside from that the poor subservient accused, who puts
the judge in a milder mood, on his historical career from the
Inquisition to political trials, judgments coloured by the trends
of the time, judgments arising from social prejudices, superstition.
faith, unbelief, that all adds up to something in the course of
time. The soldier who was always ready to march towards all
points of the compass and to shoot at anyone he was told to shoot,
anonymous and obedient, the horde. The policeman who carries
out every order, against no matter whom, a tool, devoid of all
willpower, of every social order, primitive and brutal, an
automaton with a mental outlook confined to the police station.
The parson who mouths his empty phrases, blesses and crowns the
rich, preaches humility to the poor and promises them the Kingdon
of Heaven, who pours curses upon Communism because it demands
heaven on earth for all, not for the few. Who as a Puritan is
convinced that the citizen (human being) partakes of divine grace
in proportion to his wealth in earthly goods, so that the
wealthiest is closest to God, the poorest furthest from HIM.

Emperors, kings and the nobility used to belong to the first
category, now it's arms manufacturers, owners of oilwells, giants
of industry. The doctor, who "in case of necessity" perforns
enuthenasia and the vivisection of political unreliables. The
industrialist, who liquidates the weaker party, when business
stagnates, puts the worker on minimum wages, grants him a weekly
or monthly gratuity. The peasant with his rapacity and stupid
piety. The worker with his reduced intellectual needs, he
wants to go to the movies, watch television or football; this
mental zero with his public library.
With its past and present every European country, civil servants
and citizens, has a history which would bring a criminal into
prison as an incorrigible.
So I sailed into the arms of prohibition, which would almost have
crushed me, had I not heard his voice from Mount Olympus: What
is to be done, spake Zeus, the gods are druhk. I decided to
take my place in the ranks of the righteous band of the Gothamites
and misfits and study philosophy and psychology to discover what
keeps the world in one piece in spite of everything. For a while
I flew the flag at half mast. Yet no one mourned. Bit by bit I
shifted the navel of my world from place to place, a globetrotter
to whom the earth's surface, these trifling 510 million square
kilometres, is always too small, trying all the time to discover
what's under its make-up, in my own way, on the unending journey
from the magma core to Etna, from the zero meridian to the fixed
star, from the fixed star to Fort Knox, from Fort Knox to the
Mount of Olives, from the Mount of Olives to the Bobaum, from the
Bobaum to Mecca, Manchester and Peking. I came back into this
world at last, only to set off for another. Thus began my ballet
in the rococo theatre with the straw: I kiss your hand, Pan,
mouth to mouth with a nymph. Sounds of a flute. Valhalla of the
muses. But when I noticed that in my fatal position there were
some movements which I was unable to make, such as praying,
going down on my knees, aiming at hearts or heads, the customary
protuberances of hysteria developed. In the capacity of steward
I boarded a jet, flew upwards, later I noticed that I was flying
down again (to the runway). I landed. Mute, I listen to

La Traviata as it whizzes through the air, I water the Sahara,
murder tsetse flies, conduct the Pacific Ocean into the
Mediterranean, cross the Atlantic, raise my Atlantis once more
from the waters and in daytime sink it again in a Red Sea, and
dive nightly like a shark mannikin into the yellow sea before the
white house, smoke a meerschaum pipe among pike, for I can feel
that land and water are no more. With an elevation superbe I
arise from out of primeval floods and sit in the lobby with the
keys of Heaven and Hell. No one closes and no one opens.
